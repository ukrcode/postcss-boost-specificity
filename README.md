## [Changelog](https://github.com/MadLittleMods/postcss-increase-specificity/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Documentation in [ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ ukrainean](./README_uk.md)

[PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) plugin to boost(increase) the specicity of your selectors.

It is hugely inspired by [MadLittleMods/postcss-increase-specificity](https://github.com/MadLittleMods/postcss-increase-specificity) but it is not a copy, it has different API and the code is written from scratch.

The reason I created it was, that initial plugin is not supported by the author and uses outdated dependencies.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D postcss-boost-specificity
```

## How does it work?

Basically it add additional selector to each of yours selectors to improve their weight.

**Initial CSS:**

```css
html {
  background: #bada55;
}

.batman {
  background: #fff;
}

#main-hero {
  color: red;
}

[id="main-hero"] {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

**Result CSS:**

```css
html:not(#\9):not(#\9):not(#\9) {
  background: #bada55;
}

:not(#\9):not(#\9):not(#\9) .batman {
  background: #fff;
}

:not(#\9):not(#\9):not(#\9) #main-hero {
  color: red;
}

:not(#\9):not(#\9):not(#\9) [id="main-hero"] {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

- By default it uses `:not(#\9)` selector and adds it your selector. But you can provide your own substitute. Here you can find all the discussion related to it [What is the most character-efficient way to increase CSS specificity?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19399625/what-is-the-most-character-efficient-way-to-increase-css-specificity)

## Options

- `booster`: a string, CSS selector to prepend(append for root selector like `html, :root, :host`) to each of your selectors.
  - the default value is: `:not(#\9)`. It increases specificity by `id` for each repeated time.
  - to use the default `booster` you don't have to update your `HTML`.
  - _Warning: The default `:not(#\9)` pseudo-class selector is not supported in `IE` browsers. If it is an issue for you, please provide the substitute.
- `repeat`: a number, it says how many times to repeat `options.booster` for your selectors
  - the default value is: `3`

## Scripts

- `npm test`: single tests run
- `npm run test:watch`: test run in a "watch" mode
